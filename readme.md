## Introducción al proyecto

In this project we want to address the prediction of matches of the Qatar 2022 World Cup. To do so, we will use different techniques that we have seen in class to perform this prediction.

We will use the following Kaggle dataset, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brenda89/fifa-world-cup-2022, where we can find the exact results of national team soccer matches from 1993 to 2022. The project will consist of the following two algorithms:

1. Supervised learning: predicting the outcome of Qatar 2022 world cup matches.

2. Unsupervised learning: team grouping based on their defense, center and attack scores.
